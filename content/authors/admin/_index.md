Hello! I warmly welcome you to my official home page.

I am a statistician, specialised in applied statistics and data science. Currently I am working as a research fellow at the [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) affiliated with [ARC Center of Excellence for Mathematics and Statistical Frontiers](https://acems.org.au/home).

I completed my PhD at the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics/), Monash University,  under the supervision of [Prof. Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Prof. Anastasios Panagiotelis](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/anastasios-panagiotelis) and [Prof. George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos). My dissertation was on hierarchical forecasting methods, mainly focusing on the probabilistic framework. Upon the completion of my PhD, I started an internship with the smart pricing team at Wal-Mart eCommerce in Silicon Valley, Califonia. I presumed this was a great opportunity to understand how the theoretical statistics can be applied for forecasting in scientific business management.

I enjoy myself exploring new depths in statistics and applying statistical concepts on real life matters. I often use R and Python languages to come up with data driven solutions.

Apart from the subject interests, most of my leisure time is spent on trying new recipes in cooking, travelling, and gardening.
