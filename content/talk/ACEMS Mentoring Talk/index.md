abstract: "In this talk, we are going to share our experiences from our overseas internship programs. We have both just returned from two very different internship experiences at Walmart and Amazon in Silicon Valley.  We will be talking about our motivation to do an internship along with our PhD studies, how we acquired the opportunity, and what we learned about the process, the industry and ourselves along the way. We hope to make this an interactive session so please bring along all your questions!"
